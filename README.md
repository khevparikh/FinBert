# FinBert

Poster: 

Information about financial data is highly valuable as it gives insight into the company’s revenue, growth and risks which is beneficial to companies, investors and the industry as a whole with the power to move markets. This led to the development of FinBERT, a stateof- the-art language model based on Google’s BERT that adapts specifically to the finance domain. 
- Replicate the FinBERT model to analyse the sentiment behind financial texts and understand where it may have room for improvements.
- Fine-tune the model on different datasets to improve sentiment analysis in the areas that the model failed to perform well. 
- Extend the model to identify ESG goals of publicly traded US companies.
- Examine how FinBERT performs as compared to the BERT base model and if training on financial data makes a difference.
